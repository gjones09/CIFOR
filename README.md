Introduction

	A limited number of public health foodborne disease programs receive daily reports from their public health laboratory, 
	and fewer still receive the information in a format which facilitates rapid identification of foodborne disease clusters. 
	Programs with good data handling practices are generally more successful at identifying and successfully investigating 
	in-state and multistate foodborne disease outbreaks. Rapid identification of foodborne disease clusters improves case 
	recall during investigations and increases the chance that an outbreak will be solved and public health interventions 
	will be successful.  

	Under the auspices of the Council to Improve Foodborne Outbreak Response (CIFOR), the Association of Public Health 
	Laboratories (APHL) worked with a contractor and several pilot sites to develop software that facilitates structured 
	reporting of laboratory data, leading to the rapid identification of foodborne disease clusters by public health 
	personnel. The software has been designed to be database independent and platform independent, and represents a 
	universal technology which can be used to improve outbreak detection until automated and continuous electronic 
	epidemiology/laboratory links and cluster detection and evaluation mechanisms can be established.  The software 
	can also be used to share information between jurisdictions for regional surveillance, and may be modified to accept 
	data from both epidemiology and laboratory systems to create integrated reports. 

Product Overview

	The CIFOR software is an open source application that accepts laboratory data files in a prescribed format (Table 1). 
	The application analyzes patient laboratory results (e.g. serotype, subtype and other) to identify patterns or clusters 
	that would suggest a possible outbreak or situation of interest. The application is intended as a tool for public health 
	personnel conducting disease surveillance for foodborne pathogens to more quickly identify potential clusters of enteric 
	illness within their own jurisdiction.  It is a standalone, desktop application that does not use a web browser or 
	internet access and does not share data with any other application.
